# What is Alghayma?

Alghayma, meaning “The Cloud” in arabic, is designed to be a backup solution for online content. Social networks like Facebook and YouTube have been key players for citizen journalism during the arab spring. Unfortunately, some of the content being uploaded to these networks can violate the terms of service and thus are at risk of being deleted. The content has historical and analytic value, it can be used as precious evidence if the Assad regime would be tried at the International Criminal Court. Alghayma is a easy to use tool that provides free to backups of your favorite content. Anyone can add pages to be backed up in the system at no charge. 

## What networks do you currently support?

Alghayma was quickly built after seeing an increasing number of Facebook pages being deleted. We therefore started with Facebook but we’re planning to expand with support for YouTube in the following weeks.

## Who are you? 

Alghayma is brought to you by two passionate programmers and freedom fighters:

## Exporting

We are currently working on allowing users to download a full local copy of their favorite pages. Additionaly, we want to provide *torrent* downloads of the full Alghayma database and attachements. 

## Help us

Alghayma is *free and open-source* software. You can find us on GitHub to report bugs or help us improve the system. You might even get some Alghayma *swag* :)
