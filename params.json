Social networks like Facebook and YouTube have been key players for citizen journalism during the arab spring. Unfortunately, some of the content being uploaded to these networks can violate the terms of service and thus are at risk of being deleted. The content has historical and analytic value, it can be used as precious evidence if the Assad regime would be tried at the International Criminal Court. Alghayma is a easy to use tool that provides free to backups of your favorite content. Anyone can add pages to be backed up in the system at no charge.\r\n\r\n## How can I get my page backed up?\r\n\r\nVisit [our website www.alghayma.com](https://www.alghayma.com) and enter the URL of your page into the text box. If we already backup your page, you will be shown the last version of that backup. If not, we'll start backing it up.\r\n\r\n## What networks do you currently support?\r\n\r\nAlghayma was quickly built after seeing an increasing number of Facebook pages being deleted. We therefore started with Facebook but we’re planning to expand with support for YouTube in the following weeks.\r\n\r\n## Who are you? \r\n\r\nAlghayma is brought to you by two passionate programmers and freedom fighters:\r\n\r\n- **[Frederic Jacobs](https://twitter.com/Fredericjacobs)**\r\n\r\n- **[Batikh Souri](https://twitter.com/BatikhSouri)**\r\n\r\n## Exporting\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on allowing users to download a full local copy of their favorite pages. Additionaly, we want to provide *torrent* downloads of the full Alghayma database and attachements. \r\n\r\n## Help us\r\n\r\nAlghayma is *free and open-source* software. You can find us on GitHub to report bugs or help us improve the system. You might even get some Alghayma *swag* :)\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank:\r\n\r\n- [Salah Sibaï](https://twitter.com/salah_sibai) ([`salah_sibai`](http://dribbble.com/salah_sibai)) for designing the Alghayma logo.\r\n- [Arnaud Benard](https://twitter.com/arnaudbenard) ([`arnaudbenard`](https://github.com/arnaudbenard/)) for substantial contributions improving your Alghayma experience.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nWant to reach out to us?
